Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, with which country did Kuwait first wish to establish diplomatic cooperation?\nA: ", "response": {"In 2010, with which country did Kuwait first wish to establish diplomatic cooperation?": ["In 2010, which countries did Kuwait express a desire to establish diplomatic cooperation with?", "Which country was the first one among them?"]}}

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who did the Government of Germany denounce on the same month of Iraq?\nA: ", "response": {"Who did the Government of Germany denounce on the same month of Iraq?": ["Which month did the Government of Germany denounce Iraq?", "Who did the Government of Germany denounce in #1?"]}}

{"prompt": "You are an expert in problem decomposition. Every problem needs to be decomposed into sub-problems. Please generate a hierarchical question decomposition tree (HQDT) with json format for a given question. In this tree, the root node is the original complex question, and each non-root node is a sub-question of its parent. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who made optimistic remarks about China in the same month?\nA: ", "response": {"Who made optimistic remarks about China in the same month?": ["Which month did someone make optimistic remarks about China?", "Who made optimistic remarks about China in #1?"]}}

Normalize all such time expressions to the international standard time format: Dates → YYYY-MM-DD, Months → YYYY-MM, Years → YYYY.\nReplace the original time expression in the question with its normalized format. Do not alter any other part of the question. Do not abbreviate any country or entity names. Do not add or remove information.\nJust return the modified question in JSON format with an empty list as its value.\n2.If the problem involves the situation of a \"before+ entity\" like \"before Japan\", the original problem needs to be decomposed into sub-problems. First, generate an explicit sub-question to determine the time (e.g., \"When did Iran…?\"). When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who rejected Iran before the citizens of State Actor did?\nA: {\"Who rejected Iran before the citizens of State Actor did?\": [\"When did the citizens of State Actor reject Iran?\", \"Who rejected Iran before #1?\"]}\nQ: After Japan, who made South Korea suffer from conventional military forces?\nA: {\"After Japan, who made South Korea suffer from conventional military forces?\": [\"When did Japan make South Korea suffer from conventional military forces?\", \"Who make South Korea suffer from conventional military forces after #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Qatar appeal to after April 2011?\nA: {\"Which country did Qatar appeal to after 2011-04?\": []}\nQ: Before 14 October 2015, who made Burundi suffer from conventional military forces?\nA: {\"Before 2015-10-14, who made Burundi suffer from conventional military forces?\": []}\nQ: Who had a telephone conversation with Japan after November 2005?\nA: {\"Who had a telephone conversation with Japan after 2005-11?\": []}\nQ: Who negotiated with Colombia before 22 December 2010?\nA: {\"Who negotiated with Colombia before 2010-12-22?\": []}\nQ: With which country did Qatar sign formal agreements before 15 January 2008?\nA: {\"With which country did Qatar sign formal agreements before 2008-01-15?\": []}\nQ: After November 2007, who wanted to engage in diplomatic cooperation with Timor-Leste?\nA: {\"After 2007-11, who wanted to engage in diplomatic cooperation with Timor-Leste?\": []}\nQ: Before 24 January 2005, who wanted to establish diplomatic cooperation with the Kuomintang?\nA: {\"Before 2005-01-24, who wanted to establish diplomatic cooperation with the Kuomintang?\": []}\nQ: Who negotiated with Bolivia after June 2007?\nA: {\"Who negotiated with Bolivia after 2007-06?\": []}\nQ: Before Iraq, who received Shaukat Aziz's visit from Shaukat Aziz?\nA: ", "response": {"Before Iraq, who received Shaukat Aziz's visit from Shaukat Aziz?": ["When did Shaukat Aziz visit Iraq?", "Who received Shaukat Aziz's visit from Shaukat Aziz before #1?"]}}

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In the same month as Vuk Jeremić, who wanted to negotiate with Malaysia?\nA: ", "response": {"In the same month as Vuk Jeremić, who wanted to negotiate with Malaysia?": ["which month did Vuk Jeremić want to negotiate with Malaysia?", "who wanted to negotiate with Malaysia in #1?"]}}

When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who gave a denunciation to Iraq in the same month of Angela Merkel?\nA: ", "response": {"Who gave a denunciation to Iraq in the same month of Angela Merkel?": ["Which month did Angela Merkel give a denunciation to Iraq?", "Who gave a denunciation to Iraq in #1?"]}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the United Arab Emirates make optimistic comments about on the same day as Oman?\nA: ", "response": {"Which country did the United Arab Emirates make optimistic comments about on the same day as Oman?": ["When did the United Arab Emirates make optimistic comments about Oman?", "Which country did the United Arab Emirates make optimistic comments about on #1?"]}}

{"prompt": "You are an expert in problem decomposition. Every problem needs to be decomposed into sub-problems. Please generate a hierarchical question decomposition tree (HQDT) with json format for a given question. In this tree, the root node is the original complex question, and each non-root node is a sub-question of its parent. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2013, with which country did China first express interest in cooperation?\nA: ", "response": {"In 2013, with which country did China first express interest in cooperation?": ["In 2013, which countries did China express interest in cooperation with?", "Which country was the first one among them?"]}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who was pessimistic about Thailand in the same year as Thai Airways?\nA: ", "response": {"Who was pessimistic about Thailand in the same year as Thai Airways?": ["Which year was Thai Airways involved in events concerning Thailand?", "Who was pessimistic about Thailand in #1?"]}}
