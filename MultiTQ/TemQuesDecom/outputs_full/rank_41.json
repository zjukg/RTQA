In this tree, the root node is the original complex question, and each non-root node is a sub-question of its parent. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who was praised by Rupiah Banda on the same month of Burundi?\nA: ", "response": {"Who was praised by Rupiah Banda on the same month of Burundi?": ["Which month did Rupiah Banda praise someone?", "Who was praised by Rupiah Banda in #1?"]}}

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Which country did China criticise first in 2014?\nA: ", "response": {"Which country did China criticise first in 2014?": ["Which country did China criticise in 2014?", "Which country was the first one among them?"]}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: With whom did China sign an agreement with the military of Singapore in the same month?\nA: ", "response": {"error": "JSON解析失败"}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question.

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who did the International Monetary Fund want to meet on the same year of China?\nA: ", "response": {"Who did the International Monetary Fund want to meet on the same year of China?": ["Which year did the International Monetary Fund want to meet China?", "Who did the International Monetary Fund want to meet in #1?"]}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Which country did China negotiate with first in 2006?\nA: ", "response": {"Which country did China negotiate with first in 2006?": ["Which country negotiated with China in 2006?", "Which country was the first one among them?"]}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question.

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who visited Burundi in the same year as Eimert van Middelkoop?\nA: ", "response": {"Who visited Burundi in the same year as Eimert van Middelkoop?": ["Which year did Eimert van Middelkoop visit Burundi?", "Who visited Burundi in #1?"]}}

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who visited China on the same day as Ai Weiwei?\nA: ", "response": {"Who visited China on the same day as Ai Weiwei?": ["When did Ai Weiwei visit China?", "Who visited China on #1?"]}}
