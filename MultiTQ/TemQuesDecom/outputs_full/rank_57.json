Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question.

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2013, with which country did China last express the intention to engage in diplomatic cooperation?\nA: ", "response": {"In 2013, with which country did China last express the intention to engage in diplomatic cooperation?": ["In 2013, which countries did China express the intention to engage in diplomatic cooperation with?", "Which country was the last one among them?"]}}

In this tree, the root node is the original complex question, and each non-root node is a sub-question of its parent. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who last made China suffer from conventional military forces in 2007?\nA: ", "response": {"Who last made China suffer from conventional military forces in 2007?": ["Which entities made China suffer from conventional military forces in 2007?", "Which entity among them was the last one to do so?"]}}
{"prompt": "You are an expert specializing in dealing with problems containing the keywords \"before/after\". You need to read the question carefully.\n1.If the problem involves a situation like \"before December 13, 2005\" with a \"before+ timestamp\", there is no need to decompose the original problem. Just convert the question into a JSON object where the question is the key and the value is an empty list.\nCarefully check for any temporal expressions in the question, including non-standard or natural language expressions of time such as \"in January 2010\", \"on 7 July 2007\", \"March 2006\". Normalize all such time expressions to the international standard time format: Dates → YYYY-MM-DD, Months → YYYY-MM, Years → YYYY.\nReplace the original time expression in the question with its normalized format.

Normalize all such time expressions to the international standard time format: Dates → YYYY-MM-DD, Months → YYYY-MM, Years → YYYY.\nReplace the original time expression in the question with its normalized format. Do not alter any other part of the question. Do not abbreviate any country or entity names. Do not add or remove information.\nJust return the modified question in JSON format with an empty list as its value.\n2.If the problem involves the situation of a \"before+ entity\" like \"before Japan\", the original problem needs to be decomposed into sub-problems. First, generate an explicit sub-question to determine the time (e.g., \"When did Iran…?\"). When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who rejected Iran before the citizens of State Actor did?\nA: {\"Who rejected Iran before the citizens of State Actor did?\": [\"When did the citizens of State Actor reject Iran?\", \"Who rejected Iran before #1?\"]}\nQ: After Japan, who made South Korea suffer from conventional military forces?\nA: {\"After Japan, who made South Korea suffer from conventional military forces?\": [\"When did Japan make South Korea suffer from conventional military forces?\", \"Who make South Korea suffer from conventional military forces after #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Qatar appeal to after April 2011?\nA: {\"Which country did Qatar appeal to after 2011-04?\": []}\nQ: Before 14 October 2015, who made Burundi suffer from conventional military forces?\nA: {\"Before 2015-10-14, who made Burundi suffer from conventional military forces?\": []}\nQ: Who had a telephone conversation with Japan after November 2005?\nA: {\"Who had a telephone conversation with Japan after 2005-11?\": []}\nQ: Who negotiated with Colombia before 22 December 2010?\nA: {\"Who negotiated with Colombia before 2010-12-22?\": []}\nQ: With which country did Qatar sign formal agreements before 15 January 2008?\nA: {\"With which country did Qatar sign formal agreements before 2008-01-15?\": []}\nQ: After November 2007, who wanted to engage in diplomatic cooperation with Timor-Leste?\nA: {\"After 2007-11, who wanted to engage in diplomatic cooperation with Timor-Leste?\": []}\nQ: Before 24 January 2005, who wanted to establish diplomatic cooperation with the Kuomintang?\nA: {\"Before 2005-01-24, who wanted to establish diplomatic cooperation with the Kuomintang?\": []}\nQ: Who negotiated with Bolivia after June 2007?\nA: {\"Who negotiated with Bolivia after 2007-06?\": []}\nQ: Who did the head of government of Kenya commend before Thailand?\nA: ", "response": {"Who did the head of government of Kenya commend before Thailand?": ["When did the head of government of Kenya commend Thailand?", "Who did the head of government of Kenya commend before #1?"]}}

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who would wish to visit China on the same day of Robert Hill?\nA: ", "response": {"Who would wish to visit China on the same day of Robert Hill?": ["When did Robert Hill wish to visit China?", "Who would wish to visit China on #1?"]}}

In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: Who expressed cooperation to South Korea in the same month as Kuwait?\nA: ", "response": {"Who expressed cooperation to South Korea in the same month as Kuwait?": ["which month did Kuwait express cooperation to South Korea?", "who expressed cooperation to South Korea in #1?"]}}

Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions.\nthe following is a discussion on different situations.\nIf the problem contains \"in the same year/month to xxx\", the time \"when xxx occurred\" should be asked first, \"which year did xxx...\" Or \"which month did xxx...\" Specifically, the granularity of year/month is determined based on the problem. When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer.\nIf the problem contains a situation similar to \"first/last in 2005\", a sub-problem should be broken down first to ask which events occurred in 2005, and then the second sub-problem is to ask which one occurred the earliest and the latest among these events. do not use placeholders : The answer to the previous sub-question is a set of entities (e.g., multiple people or countries), And these entities cannot be directly embedded into the next question. In such cases, phrase the next question using expressions like \"among them\" or \"which of them\" to indicate selection.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nQ: Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\nA: {\"Who was the first to request a meeting with Togo in 2005?\": [\"Who requested a meeting with Togo in 2005?\", \"Who among them made the first request?\"]}\nQ: Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\nA: {\"Which country last praised Iran in 2009?\": [\"Which country praised Iran in 2009?\", \"Which country among them praised Iran at the latest date?\"]}\nQ: Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\nA: {\"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in the same year?\": [\"Which year did Abdelkader Messahel visit Mauritania?\", \"Who hosted the visit of Abdelkader Messahel to Mauritania in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\nA: {\"Who was the first country to sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\": [\"Which country sign formal agreements with Iran in 2007?\", \"who was the first country among them?\"]}\nQ: Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\nA: {\"Who praised Iran in the same month as Nacer Mehal?\": [\"which month did Nacer Mehal praise Iran?\", \"who praised Iran in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\nA: {\"Who did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain in the same month?\": [\"Which month did Iran give the criticism of the Muslims of Bahrain?\", \"who did Iran give criticism of in #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\nA: {\"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on the same day of Qatar?\": [\"when did the envoy of Sudan meet Qatar?\", \"Which country did the envoy of Sudan want to meet on #1?\"]}\nQ: Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\nA: {\"Which country did Colombia negotiate with in the same year as Japan?\": [\"which year did Colombia negotiate with Japan?\", \"which country did Colombia negotiate with in #1?\"]}\nQ: Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\nA: {\"Who made an appeal to Iran on the same day as Xi Jinping?\": [\"when did Xi Jinping make an appeal to Iran?\", \"who made an appeal to Iran on #1?\"]}\nQ: With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\nA: {\"With which country did Guatemala last express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\": [\"with which country did Guatemala express its willingness to negotiate in 2006?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\nA: {\"In 2010, which country was the last to sign formal agreements with Mauritania?\": [\"in 2010, which country signed formal agreements with Mauritania?\", \"which country was the last one among them?\"]}\nQ: About which country did China make optimistic remarks on the same day as Donald Rumsfeld?\nA: ", "response": {"About which country did China make optimistic remarks on the same day as Donald Rumsfeld?": ["When did Donald Rumsfeld make optimistic remarks?", "About which country did China make optimistic remarks on #1?"]}}

Do not add or remove information.\nJust return the modified question in JSON format with an empty list as its value.\n2.If the problem involves the situation of a \"before+ entity\" like \"before Japan\", the original problem needs to be decomposed into sub-problems. First, generate an explicit sub-question to determine the time (e.g., \"When did Iran…?\"). When a sub-question logically depends on the answer to a previous one, use placeholders (e.g., #1) to refer to that answer. Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree.
