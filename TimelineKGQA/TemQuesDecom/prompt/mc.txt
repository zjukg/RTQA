Please generate a hierarchical question decomposition tree (HQDT) in JSON format for the given question.
The tree must have only one level of depth: the root node is the original complex question, and it may be directly decomposed into at most three atomic sub-questions. Sub-questions must not be further decomposed.
Return a valid JSON object representing the question tree. Each key is a parent question, and its value is a list of sub-questions. The list should contain no more than 3 sub-questions, and all must be atomic (not further decomposable).
